# TestIO

TestIO is a desktop console application, which takes files from the same folder as TestIO.exe, if files are named "system_input_file.1630412935.txt" and "system_output_file.1630412935.txt". It checks data in them and creates a resulting file "test_report.txt", which consists of lines with test result for each set of input data. According to requirements, TestIO logs a reason of FAIL test into console output. In order to try this program themself, one should download source code and build the application, create test data and run the program.
